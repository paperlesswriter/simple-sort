# simple-sort
Bash script that quickly groups files by media type and moves them to separate folders.

Sorting is lightning fast: Simply start the script in a directory - all files there are immediately moved to subfolders.
The file can be easily edited and supplemented - simply call it up in the text editor and design the opening credits as you wish.
